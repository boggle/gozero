ZMQ bindings for Go.

These are EXPERIMENTAL libzmq bindings for the the Go language.

Contexts, sockets, and messages have been implemented along
with Send, and Receive.  No Poll, no setSocketOpts at this time.
There is a simple client server test program, no coverage or testing
beyond that has been done so far.

To setup, you first need to install 

github.com/boggle/coffer (for copying memory between C and go)
github.com/boggle/gonewrong (for error handling)

Install: make clean install
Main: make clsrv

Run

./clsrv cl|srv|all addr

cl  - client
srv - server
all - both
