THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL, CURRENTLY BROKEN, AND NEEDS YOUR EXPERTISE.

ZMQ bindings for Go.

This is a very early attempt at libzmq bindings to the Go language.

To run this you first need to install github.com/boggle/coffer
which is a small package for copying memory between C and go.

Basic contexts, sockets, and messages have been implemented along
with Send, and Receive.  No Poll, no setSocketOpts at this time.

Out of the box this gives you inproc communication and tcp, see main.go. 
IPC is broken for some yet unknown reason.  TCP only works with one
socket per UNIX process, so you can use tcp between go processes but
not inside a single go process.  Bugs abound.  Wouldnt mind anyone 
picking this up. Thanks!
