THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND ALPHA

gozero
======

ZMQ bindings for Go.

This is a very early attempt at libzmq bindings to the Go language.

To setup, you first need to install github.com/boggle/coffer
which is a small package for copying memory between C and go.

Basic contexts, sockets, and messages have been implemented along
with Send, and Receive.  No Poll, no setSocketOpts at this time.

Install: make clean install
Main: make clsrv

Run

./clsrv cl|srv|all addr

cl  - client
srv - server
all - both
