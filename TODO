- Implement missing methods: Fix Zerocopy API mem handling, SetSockOpt

- Get some test coverage by implementing the tutorial stuff from zeromq.org

- LL interface: Here for maximal performance...
- Reduce footshooting chance by moving from *foo **foo and nil on Close()

- Thoughts about HL interface:
	- HL interface: Here to protect you, no easy foot shooting
	- SocketManager: Manages Sockets. :-) Requires Reification of LL interface into go messages
    (Create Socket, Drop Socket etc. or clever use of lambdas sent to SocketManager via some
     control channel)
  - PushForwarder
  - PullForwarder
	- Channel registry
  - Helpers for encoding native go format and protobuf?
  - Still wish I knew how to cast []byte into a unsafe.Pointer

- I really need to think about leaks, esp concerning setsockopt and watches, its not totally clear
  who frees what when
