- LL interface: Here for maximal performance...

- Seriously think about memory management / who free's what etc.
  - Interesting cases: SetBinDataSockOpt, Send/Receive w. Coffer from Go
  - Document behaviour
  - Maybe introduce few bool flags to be more safe wrt mem

- Get some test coverage by implementing the tutorial stuff from zeromq.org

- Reduce footshooting chance by moving from *foo **foo and nil on Close()

- Thoughts about HL interface:
	- HL interface: Here to protect you, no easy foot shooting
	- SocketManager: Manages Sockets. :-) Requires Reification of LL interface into go messages
    (Create Socket, Drop Socket etc. or clever use of lambdas sent to SocketManager via some
     control channel)
  - PushForwarder / PullForwarder vs zmq inproc comm via per-thread socket (How to do that...)
	- Channel registry
  - Helpers for encoding native go format and protobuf?
