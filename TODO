- LL interface: Here for maximal performance...
- Finish copying version of Message
  - May already require reflect to peel apart []byte pointers or 
    reify byte* data into []byte's although that raises quite a few
    GC questions... so better go the other way round
- Test Send/Receive
- Wait for golang to replace their GC()...
- Try wether (un)reflect + C-based alloca is enough for stack allocation of Messages
  - Open Question: How to get free right...

- Thoughts about HL interface:
	- HL interface: Here to protect you, no easy foot shooting
	- SocketManager: Manages Sockets. :-) Requires Reification of LL interface into go messages
    (Create Socket, Drop Socket etc. or clever use of lambdas sent to SocketManager via some
     control channel)

  - PullForwarder
  - Helpers for encoding native go format and protobuf
